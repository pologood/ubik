 * A general subscription listener can be useful in the case where
 * multiple subscriptions match a notification and the client only
 * wishes to process each notification once. Another way to handle
 * this would be to mark processed notifications with the
 * {@link AvisEventObject#setData(String, Object)} and
 * {@link AvisEventObject#getData(String)} methods.
